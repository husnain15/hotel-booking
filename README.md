**Steps to Run a React Project from GitHub**
Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository using the URL provided on GitHub.

bash
Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
Replace [repository-url] with the actual URL of the repository. For example:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change into the directory of the cloned repository.

bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
Replace repository-name with the name of the directory created by the clone command.

Install Dependencies:
Use npm or yarn to install the project’s dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

bash
Copy code
npm install
or, if you’re using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Run the Development Server:
Start the development server to run the React application.

bash
Copy code
npm start
or, if you’re using yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn start
Open in Browser:
Once the server starts, it will usually open the application in your default web browser automatically. If not, you can open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
This is the default URL for React applications running on the local server.
