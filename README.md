**Steps to Run a React Project from GitHub**
Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository using the URL provided on GitHub.

git clone git@github.com:husnain15/hotel-booking.git

Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change into the directory of the cloned repository.

cd hotel-booking

Install Dependencies:
Use npm or yarn to install the project’s dependencies. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

npm install
or, if you’re using yarn:

yarn install
Run the Development Server:
Start the development server to run the React application.

npm start
or, if you’re using yarn:

yarn start
Open in Browser:
Once the server starts, it will usually open the application in your default web browser automatically. If not, you can open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:3000
This is the default URL for React applications running on the local server.
